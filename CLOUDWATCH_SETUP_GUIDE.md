## üìñ How to Use

### Viewing Graphs
1. Navigate to the [CloudWatch Dashboard](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=ap-southeast-2#dashboards:name=college-safe-comprehensive-monitoring)
2. Graphs update automatically every 5 minutes
3. Click on any graph to zoom in or adjust time range
4. Use the time selector at the top to view historical data

### Viewing Traces
1. Go to [X-Ray Service Map](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home?region=ap-southeast-2#/service-map)
2. Click on any service node to see details
3. Navigate to [Traces](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home?region=ap-southeast-2#/traces) to see individual requests
4. Filter traces by:
   - Status (Success/Error)
   - Response time
   - HTTP status code
   - Time range

### Running Log Queries
1. Go to [CloudWatch Logs Insights](https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=ap-southeast-2#logsV2:logs-insights)
2. Select log groups starting with `/aws/lambda/college-safe-serverless-`
3. Copy queries from `cloudwatch-logs-insights-queries.md`
4. Adjust time range and run query

### Responding to Alarms
When an alarm triggers:
1. Check the dashboard for visual context
2. Review recent error logs
3. Analyze X-Ray traces for the time period
4. Use Logs Insights to deep dive into issues

## üß™ Testing the Setup

Generate test data by:
```bash
# Make API calls to your endpoints
curl https://your-api-gateway-url/api/login
curl https://your-api-gateway-url/api/users
# etc...
```

## üìÅ Configuration Files

- `cloudwatch-enhanced-dashboard.json` - Dashboard configuration
- `cloudwatch-monitoring.yml` - Original CloudFormation template
- `cloudwatch-logs-insights-queries.md` - Pre-built queries
- `deploy-cloudwatch-dashboard.sh` - Deployment script
- `verify-cloudwatch-setup.sh` - Verification script

## üîß Maintenance

### Updating Dashboard
```bash
# Edit cloudwatch-enhanced-dashboard.json
# Then run:
aws cloudwatch put-dashboard \
    --dashboard-name "college-safe-comprehensive-monitoring" \
    --dashboard-body file://cloudwatch-enhanced-dashboard.json \
    --region ap-southeast-2
```

### Adding New Metrics
1. Edit `cloudwatch-enhanced-dashboard.json`
2. Add new widget configuration
3. Deploy using the update command above

### Adjusting Alarms
```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
    --alarm-name "your-alarm-name" \
    --alarm-description "Description" \
    --metric-name MetricName \
    --namespace AWS/Lambda \
    --statistic Sum \
    --period 300 \
    --threshold 10 \
    --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
    --evaluation-periods 2
```

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

- Dashboard: ~$3/month per dashboard
- X-Ray: $5 per million traces recorded
- CloudWatch Logs: $0.50 per GB ingested
- Alarms: $0.10 per alarm per month

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Set up SNS notifications for alarms
2. Configure custom metrics from your application
3. Create automated responses to alarms
4. Set up log retention policies
5. Configure cross-region monitoring if needed

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check X-Ray traces for error details
2. Review CloudWatch Logs for error messages
3. Use Logs Insights queries for deep analysis
4. Monitor dashboard for trends
